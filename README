Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


Using cmpe283-1.c, we can discover additional features about VMX. 

For the below MSRs, added the functionality to see their features.
IA32_VMX_PINBASED_CTLS 0x481  
IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS 0x482 
IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS2 0x48B 
IA32_VMX_EXIT_CTLS 0x483   
IA32_VMX_ENTRY_CTLS 0x484  
IA32_VMX_PROCBASED_CTLS3
